    <br>
    
        <!-- TEXT-->
    <p>
        You’re “too invested” when you double-text but a “pushover” when you respond to a single chat. You can’t send walls of text because that shows you’re an “emotional mess,” but short replies seem “cold and uninterested” in the conversation. We make all these rules and guidelines up whenever we talk online but they all seem to contradict each other. There are different rules for each gender, status, and relationship that we can’t just seem to agree upon. So, how should we text and what does it take to be an effective texter?
    </p>    
    
    <p>
        What a lot of us forget when we text is that it still very much falls under communication. It relies on sending and receiving signals between two people: both verbal and nonverbal cues. The convenience of texting comes in its ability to be sent, read, and responded to at any time. Unfortunately, being typed out into letters makes texts lose all the relevant aspects of communication that we look for in our face-to-face conversations. Nonverbal communication such as gestures, tone, and volume don't come across through instant messaging. With that in mind, the key to being an effective texter is the same as what it takes to be an effective communicator: being able to receive messages and properly understand them. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Understanding messages sounds a whole lot more difficult in text than in real life—and it’s true. We lack the tools we need to properly distinguish implicit communication messages when all that is presented to us are words and emojis. It’s difficult to detect whether someone is emotional, serious, or sarcastic. Furthermore, it might be dangerous when we mistake one kind of message for another. Even emojis were invented as if we needed hieroglyphics again to tell our stories in pictures worth a thousand words. Which exactly of these thousand meanings it could hold in each text, we still don’t quite get.
    </p>

    <p id="caption">For all we know, this person might just be asking if their partner wants eggplant omelets for dinner. <br>It could also mean something else entirely</p>
    <br>

    <p>The first point to keep in mind is that we don’t need to type out a response right away. We should pause and think critically about all the interpretations and meanings that might be taken from the message we’ve read. There is no need to rush to conclusions when we’re texting. If something frustrates us, try to give it another read with a more open and calm mind. </p>
    <p>Secondly, we can clarify by asking. Even “What do you mean?” has been abbreviated to “wdym” or “wym” because it’s such a crucial question to ask while texting to gain a clear grasp on what our friends just said. Oftentimes, we feel offended or become stressed because we conclude exactly what they meant in a text. We assume their facial expressions, tone of voice, and even what they’re doing while sending the text—I myself have certainly done that. We should remember that we don’t have those cues and information about the conversation and it’s better to just take a pause, think, and ask.</p>
    <p>On ghosting, we should be more considerate about the situation of the person we’re texting. What we consider ghosting is solely based on when we want a response from someone. A lot of things happen in people’s lives. They might get sick, a family situation may take their attention for a while, or a big school project might just be keeping them busy. In that case, you might say, “they should’ve let me know!”. Actually, they might have let us know and we’re just too unattentive while texting. It could also be an urgent matter and they don’t have the bandwidth for conversation. In any case, we’re not entitled to know about everything happening in people’s lives. If we need a quick response for an urgent matter we’re facing, don’t send a text; contact them by other means! </p>
    <p>Lastly, know that we can’t control other people’s behavior. Most of the rules we’ve made up in texting are to elicit a type of response we’re looking for. We send longer messages when we’ve had conversations with people who talk in short phrases. We mirror the monosyllabic replies from people when we interpret their messages as uninterested in our texts that look like paragraphs compared to theirs. Contrary to that, we should instead not restrict ourselves just for the sake of texting. When we sacrifice our natural behavior for a response we don’t get, we feel bitter or resentful. It’s like being upset about not getting an order we paid for. We don’t act rationally nor do we take our resentment well. Instead, we bottle them up for the next person we text to deal with. </p>
    <p>I’m not saying we should just act however wildly we feel like. Still behave like how we should behave around others outside of texting: with respect. However, we should keep in the back of our minds that there is no controlling how the person we text reacts to what we send. Be mindful of what you’re texting for. Is it enjoyment, a specific response, an honest discussion, or an understanding between you and the person you’re texting? </p>
    <p>In conclusion, texting does not have a one-size-fits-all rulebook. Assuming it does just leads to frustration when a conversation with a person doesn’t play out the same as another with someone else. Rather than assuming, we should work on open-mindedness to text messages and reading with a clear head. Don’t forget that emotions, sarcasm, and non-verbal cues are gone in texting, and we have to make up for that in terms of our critical thinking and considerate interpretations. Last but not least, we can’t control anyone’s behavior or situation. Texting is not a puzzle to be solved to gain a reward from another person but a series of communications to develop relationships and understanding between people. “Don’t worry about the rules of how to write a text, worry about how to read a text.”</p>
