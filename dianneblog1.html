    <p>
      As active internet users, we rarely read newspapers or listen to radio broadcasts because of social media. According to datareportal, analysis from Kepios shows that there were 4.74 billion social media users worldwide in October 2022, equating to 59.3 percent of the total global population. We use social media daily to feel more connected to society. As we scroll through Facebook, Twitter, and such, we consume a lot of information in a short amount of time. The content varies from harmless and humorous videos to explicit news about people or events. As we see these things day-to-day, are we slowly turning into desensitized beings?

    <p>
      Based on my experience, I can say that the information we consume makes us desensitized. But first of all, what is the definition of desensitization? According to Cambridge Dictionary, desensitization is the process of causing someone to experience something, usually an emotion or a pain, less intensely than before. As I said earlier, we consume a lot of information rapidly, meaning we do not fully understand the severity of what we just read. We do not become bothered by the news that we are not affected by because we usually scroll past information that we can't relate to, even if it is something alarming. The act of scrolling eventually becomes habitual, which makes it easier for information to escape our minds. I have also seen people making jokes out of grave situations. Most of the young adults in our generation use dark humor as their way of coping, which does not allow them to process information healthily. In short, we became less sensitive toward topics that should be disturbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Social media should be a means to be more connected to society, but what if it causes desensitization instead? Shocking or worrying events are becoming normalized because we see them frequently on social media platforms. We become numb to issues and injustices because we only have short-lived awareness. To bring about change in the world, we need to become more engaged in our consumption of information. We should get involved with the events that are happening in a way that is beneficial to us and others.    </p>
