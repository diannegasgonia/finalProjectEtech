      Social media, or the internet in general, had a significant impact on our lives. It provided us with benefits and opportunities that made our lives easier. We can maintain social connections and access more information that without technology, would be hard to achieve. It gave us the freedom to express our thoughts and opinions about any matter, whether it be positive or negative. But like all things, these benefits come with consequences. 
    </p> 
    <p>
      With the continuous increase in social media users, it is becoming harder for moderators, people who moderate an internet forum or online discussion, to sort through thousands of content posted by different people each day. The freedom we are given in posting content is like a double-edged sword that can be used for both good and bad reasons. Despite the policies and community guidelines found in social media platforms like Facebook, Youtube, Twitter, etc, there are still several people who post content that violates these terms and conditions. One example was when Logan Paul, a famous Youtuber, posted a video of his trip to a forest near Mount Fuji in Japan. In the video, he allegedly showed what seemed to be the body of a suicide victim. He even posted the video titled: “We Found a Dead Body in the Japanese Suicide Forest,” indicating that he knew what he was doing. YouTube suspended Logan Paul’s account and said the video violated its terms and conditions. This event is just one of the many incidents where harmful media is posted as “content” on different social media platforms. Now imagine, if Logan Paul was not famous or the place where he uploaded the video was not as big as Youtube, would the same procedures be done to prevent explicit content, misinformation, hate speech, and other types of harmful media disguised as content?
    </p>
    <p>
      Though this incident occurred in 2018, and I can testify that our technology has drastically improved since then—there are now automated tools used for content moderation—there are still several harmful media that stay under the radar. I believe that moderating content on the internet should not rely on these automated tools to accomplish. Computers might categorize a post as perfectly safe, but still contain things that could harm others and vice versa. Computers cannot understand the context behind a post and read between the lines. With that said, we must always stay cautious and keep in mind that nothing on the internet is safe. Although we have the right to express whatever we want to, we still have to remember to be responsible while doing so. We should only post content that would surely do no harm to others and would not violate the terms and conditions of social media platforms. These policies are implemented for us to follow and promote a community free from any sort of harmful media.
